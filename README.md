This is just the scripts I use for Linux version of palworld for server automation.

Backup-saves= Its in the name 

Broadcast= Just the rcon broadcast 

script broadcast-memory=Broadcasts ram usage at intervals 

graceful-restart=as opposed to hard crashes 

memory-pressure-restart= when ram limit is reached it will reboot the server before palserver can OOM crash
